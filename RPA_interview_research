##Finetuning the selector # application version changes the GUI, or website version changes
full # contains all elements to id any ui element
partial # contains no info about toplevel window

#fixes
-wildcards eg "*" represents 0 or more characters "?" represents a single character
-Dynamic Value through variable eg ID number, url- url can end with dynamic document version,date, number
-Image recognition (trading view add had the same format(window size) but different content add, used to autoclose)
-screen coordinates, (absolute and relative to, center, mouse pointer ) 



# bulk data handling  10k transactions +
  # challenges : storage and distribution:
  storage:
 - centralised mechanism eg orchestrator queue/work item queue
 - DB SQL server, access DB
 - Shared file -excel, csv
  
  distribution:
  -predefined rules offered by the server
  -using flags to differentiate the transactions
  -row number based processing (eg 2 bots, starting from row 1 and row 500 atst,  atthesametime
  
 
  distribution
