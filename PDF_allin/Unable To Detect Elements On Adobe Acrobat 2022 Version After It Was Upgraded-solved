Question	Why are the elements not being detected after Adobe reader was upgraded to 22.0 version ?
Issue Description + Resolution	
There is a new security feature in Acrobat Reader, version > 2022.003.20258. It seems to be enabled by default. “Enable Protected Mode at startup” has to be disabled to allow injection in the target process. To achieve this, follow the below steps:

Open Adobe Acrobat or Adobe Reader.
Click Edit.
Select Preferences.
Select Security (Enhanced).
Uncheck Enable Protected Mode at startup.
Click OK.
Close the Adobe program.
Open Adobe Acrobat or Adobe Reader again.
